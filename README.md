# qwikgame

qwikgame is a system to help people find a rival to play their favorite (real-world) game at a convenient time and place. Players are able to rate each others ability to enable qwikgame to estimate the relative strength between new rivals. Care has been taken to provide a range privacy options for players. Players are able to add and maintain information about suitable venues to play a range of games from Chess to Squash.

### relative ability

qwikgame makes estimates of the **parity** (relative ability) of potential rivals based on feedback from past rivals (and initially the players own self-assessment). This is NOT based on a ranking or grading of players; it is *relative* assessment. Players can rate each other as well-matched, stronger, weaker, much-stronger or much-weaker. If two players have previously rated each other then their ratings are combined to estimate their relative ability (the players may not be in agreement). Otherwise, qwikgame uses the ratings of a common rival, if direct ratings are not available. More weight is given to more recent ratings; and a record is kept of the reliability of the ratings provided by each player (ie how closely they coincide with rating of their rivals).
