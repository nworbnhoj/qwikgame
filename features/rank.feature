Feature: I want to import a pre-existing player ranking into qwikgame
	In order to recognise existing player rankings in qwikgame matches
	As a player
	Players need to be able to upload existing player rankings
	
	Scenario: Upload a file with rankings
	  
	
	Scenario: Activate a set of rankings
	  Given a community of Players
	  And a Squash ranking file "behatRankingSequentialA-Z" from A
	  When the ranking is Activated
	  Then A=B on day 1
	  Then A=C on day 1
	  Then A=D on day 1
	  Then A=E on day 1
	  Then A=F on day 1
	  Then A=G on day 1
	  Then A=H on day 1
	  Then A=I on day 1
	  Then A=J on day 1
	  Then A=K on day 1
	  Then A=L on day 1
	  Then A>M on day 1
	  Then A>N on day 1
	  Then A>O on day 1
	  Then A>P on day 1
	  Then A>Q on day 1
	  Then A>R on day 1
	  Then A>S on day 1
	  Then A>T on day 1
	  Then A>U on day 1
	  Then A>V on day 1
	  Then A>W on day 1
	  Then A>X on day 1
	  Then A>Y on day 1
	  Then A>Z on day 1
	  Then Z<A on day 2
	  Then Z<B on day 2
	  Then Z<C on day 2
	  Then Z<D on day 2
	  Then Z<E on day 2
	  Then Z<F on day 2
	  Then Z<G on day 2
	  Then Z<H on day 2
	  Then Z<I on day 2
	  Then Z<J on day 2
	  Then Z<K on day 2
	  Then Z<L on day 2
	  Then Z<M on day 2
	  Then Z<N on day 2
	  Then Z<O on day 2
	  Then Z=P on day 2
	  Then Z=Q on day 2
	  Then Z=R on day 2
	  Then Z=S on day 2
	  Then Z=T on day 2
	  Then Z=U on day 2
	  Then Z=V on day 2
	  Then Z=W on day 2
	  Then Z=X on day 2
	  Then Z=Y on day 2
